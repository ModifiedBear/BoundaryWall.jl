# Vector fields

!!! warning

    This is a work in progress. There are still issues regarding convergence of
    Green's dyadics near the boundary. While tests may be performed using the 
    `boundaryWallVec` function, it is advised not to use it in a rigorous manner.

## 3D geometries

By using a Green's dyadic approach, one can define an incident field 
with an altitude angle. This allows us to test the system's response
to different polarizations.
