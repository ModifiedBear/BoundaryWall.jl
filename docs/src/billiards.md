# Quantum dots & Billiards

A *quantum billiard* is a term familiar to those in quantum chaos and ergodic
systems. However, these bear close resemblance to what is known as a quantum dot
in the condensed matter community. Infinite potential wells can also be compared 
to billiards, although one can define a finite wall *strength* or *height*, and
even $\delta$ potentials that vary along the boundary. The purpose of this toolbox
is oriented towards an optical study, the [kwant](https://kwant-project.org/) package 
is better suited for quantum transport.

In this example, we calculate the inner and outer wavefunction for the eigenstates
of an elliptic billiard. 

## System setup

## $T$ matrix

One can find resonant states by scanning the spectrum of the $T$ matrix and looking 
for discontinuities and peaks.
